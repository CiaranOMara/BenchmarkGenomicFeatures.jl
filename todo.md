# TODO
- Wrap these benchmarks with [PkgBenchmark.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCI/PkgBenchmark.jl).
  - Automate comparisons between commits.


## Notes
- Although the early removal of the conversion (06a7c47e) leads to minor regressions, reinstating it at 71ae347b leads to significant regressions across the board.
